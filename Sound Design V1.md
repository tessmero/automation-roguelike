# Sound Design

The sound design is pivotal to the gameplay experience, and adds another layer to the creative aspect of the game. Contraptions are the main source of sound and music. Although these mechanics are optional (the game is playable without sound), observant players will gain practical benefits from sounds. For example, the player would know that they made a building mistake if a module doesn't sound right. Sounds may also reveal hidden mechanics of blocks. 

Without going into specifics, the overall criteria of the sound design are as follows:

* The sound/timing of a block is determined by relatively simple rules
* The rules are never given to the player, and must be discovered
* Contraptions that have different purposes have distinctly different rhythms (even if they are composed of the same types of blocks)

Below, one proposed set of rules, and their implications, are detailed. Here we reference the "shooter" blocks described in "Block Mechanics V1".

* One shooter block by itself produces a dull "thump" each time it fires (1/sec)
* Shooter blocks at different orientations fire at different quarter-second offsets. Two shooter blocks facing opposite directions produce a steady (2/sec) beat
* Shooter blocks produce a higher-pitched thump when firing extra projectiles (e.g. when they are hit by another shooter)

These rules lead to a satisfying learning experience for new players. The rules only come into play when the player begins experimenting with combinations of multiple blocks.

* pairs of nearby shooters facing eachother (efficient defense) - start slow and build up to a rapid high-pitched hum like a gattling gun.
* stacks of shooter facing the same direction (powerful defense) - upwards glissando sound 1/sec like a giant laser warming up
* modules that utilize all 4 faces of a money block (production) - they have shooters facing all directions and produce a steady 4/sec beat like a factory. 
* Modules with rotational symmetry will also "sound symmetrical", with repetitive quarter- or half-second beats.
